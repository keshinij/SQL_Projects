Line 7 WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
When we analyse our data in the excel file, we notice that there are null values in continent column. Upon further analysis, we see that the column location which include continent names, for example Africa, South America ... which in turn corresponds to the null value. Therefore, we need to exclude these from our data.
Line 8 With ORDER BY, we don't need to write column name, we can only write the coulmn number
